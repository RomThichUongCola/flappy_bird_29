## Welcome!
This is Group 29's Capstone Project!
We apply some AI technique to help computer playing Flappy Bird.

## Installation
You only have to execute the following command line to complete the installation process
```bash
pip -q -r install requirements.txt
```

## Run 
You can run main.py using any IDE or code editor (please open the folder as main.py may require access to some other files for execution).
I recommend running 
```bash
python main.py
```
in terminal
